Visualizations:

Boxplot of Home Win Percentage by League (boxplot_win_pct_by_league.png)
<br>
We picked this representation because a boxplot is a great way of visualizing the difference in mean win percentages from league to league. In also gives an overview of the central tendency of the data. In this way, we can get an idea of which league offers the most significant home field advantage. Another option we considered was simple bar chart, but we deemed a boxplot more appropriate as in provides distributional information and can detect outliers.

KMeans clustering visualization (kmeans_clustering.png)
<br>
We picked this representation because a scatter plot is a conventional visualization method for displaying clusters and their distribution. It helps identify how the sports teams are distributed in respects to environmental factors and how they are classified by the KMeans model. It is hard to visualize the results when dealing with 3-dimensional and high-dimensional data. We also picked an in-fill plot for the silhouette scores to visualize how representative the sports teams are for each cluster.

Predicted Home Win Percentage(predicted_home_win_percentage.png)
<br>
We picked a bar graph because it shows well how the model assigned different home win percentages to different teams. It also was a very helpful representation to see how simulation outcomes compared to the predicted home win percentages by including the place finished in the axis labels. This visualization requires a bit of context, so perhaps grouping the different teams together may have been a viable alternative, but overall I think the bar graph works well.

Final League Table (final_league_table.png)
<br>
We picked a bar graph for the simulation results because this is an intuitive visualization for points totals which varied across teams based on the results. We could also have a table to show these results, which we ultimately did also make. Not very much additional context is needed to understand these graphs, and there wasn’t too much challenging about the representation.

Decision Tree Visualizations (give file names)
<br>
We picked representing our decision tree by showing a visualization of the tree attributes. This is a good fit because it very clearly shows important attributes and how decisions are ultimately made. There aren’t many common standard alternatives for this visualization. Some context and understanding of how decision trees work is required to understand the visualization. It was somewhat challenging to fit the entire decision tree on the image while making the text visible, but that was solved with careful styling.

<br>
Team Attributes (team_attributes.png)
<br>
We picked representing the team attributes with bar graphs as this would clearly show how the different teams compared. It was challenging fitting each attribute on an image as there are many per team. One alternative we explored was having all attributes for a team on one graph and having ten different graphs, but this didn’t work as the attribute values were very different sizes, making certain bars tiny and others huge, preventing helpful comparison. Context for what the model was doing would be helpful for this graph.

<br>
Simulated League Table (simulated_league_table.png)
<br>
We picked a table for the simulation results because this is an intuitive visualization for results and common practice across sports leagues. We could also have a bar graph to show these results, which we ultimately did also make. Not very much additional context is needed to understand these graphs.
